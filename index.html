    <!-- I kinda wanna make it so that there is a button on the side that can take you down to the calendar. 
        Void: we could try with div thingies, theres something about links and # that can do that i think
    we can just add the calendar at the bottom of the homepage, like the SC website at school, and then just make it a bit more user friendly.
    the buttons are kinda too random and lowkey useless now, what's the point of them? just gotta make one page I think, and then we will be fine
    But if time doesn't permit, then the separate pages might be okay i guess
        Void: idrc, im just gonna look through this for now
